**Objective**

Using React, build the client-side for an app called **myFlix** based on its
existing server-side code (REST API and database).

**What I've learned while working on the project**

- Introduction to Frameworks & Libraries
- Building with JavaScript
- React Components & the Virtual DOM
- React Lifecycle Methods
- React Forms
- React Bootstrap
- Client-Side App Routing
- Introduction to Redux
- Deploying & Hosting a React App

**The 5 W's**
- **Who?** The users of my myFlix app—movie enthusiasts who enjoy reading information about
different movies.
- **What?** A single-page, responsive app with routing, rich interactions, several interface views,
and a polished user experience. 
- **When?** myFlix users will be able to use it whenever they want to read and save information
about different movies.
- **Where?** The app will be hosted online. The myFlix app itself is responsive and can therefore be
used anywhere and on any device, giving all users the same experience.
- **Why?** Movie enthusiasts like to be able to access information about different movies,
whenever they want to. Having the ability to save a list of their favorite movies will ensure
users always have access to the films they want to watch or recommend to their peers.

**User Stories**
```
As a user, I want to be able to access information about movies so that I can learn more
about movies I’ve watched or am interested in.
```
```
As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.
```

**Technical Requirements**
- The application must be a **single-page application (SPA)**
- The application must use **state routing** to navigate between views and share URLs
- The application must give users the option to filter movies using a **“search”** feature
- The application must use **Parcel** as its build tool
- The application must be written using the **React library** and in **ES2015+**
- The application must use **Bootstrap** as a UI library for styling and responsiveness
- The application must contain **function components**
- The application must be **hosted online**
- The application may use **React Redux** for state management of at least one feature (i.e.,
filtering movies)
