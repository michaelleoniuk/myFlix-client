I implemented all the instructions in the “Creating a New Repository” and “Configuring Parcel for my myFlix App” sections.

I tested my project using Parcel: parcel [Path to index.html]. I need to make sure I use the actual path to “index.html” instead of [Path to index.html] (relative to the current directory I am inside).

I created a new gh-pages branch.
